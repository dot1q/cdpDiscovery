<h1>About</h1>
<p>This repo is simply an example for some angular testing. A couple of goals of mine were:
    <ul>
        <li>Angular ES6</li>
        <li>UI Router</li>
        <li>Vis JS Angular</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, gulp and build tasks were implemented to make life easier :)
    <ul>
        <li>Browser sync on edits</li>
        <li>Webpack, dawg</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This is a proof of concept to see if on the fly network mapping could solve the problem of an ever changing network. 
        Yes, documentation is great, but how much greater would it be if we could spend less time documenting and more time drinking beer? </p>
